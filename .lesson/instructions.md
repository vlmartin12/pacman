# ICS4U - Rich Summative Task
## Description and Requirements

### General Outline: 

The final project encompasses your understanding of the course material. It should include one _**or more**_ of the following:
- Sorting or Searching
- Recursion (with or without divide & conquer)
- Complex Data Structures (multi-dimensional arrays / matrices)
- Abstract Data Types (pseudo-objects using key,value pairs)
- Object Oriented Programming (Classes)
- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern
  - Back-to-Front-End Development (HTML)
  - (_optional_) Usage of the `<canvas>` element 
  - (_optional_) Animation through either `setInterval()` or `requestAnimationFrame()`   
  - (_optional_) Collisions & movement 

Note that OOP is highly recommended, mostly if you plan on continuing with computer science in your future.

This final project will be an application built using JavaScript, HTML, & CSS through the Replit IDE. It is worth 30% of your final grade.

### If you wish to complete your final project using Unity or some other system, contact your teacher ASAP.

### Requirements:
(see rubric further below)
- Per-Project proposal including minimum expectations
- Draft User Interface (storyboarding)
- Obvious entry to the application or game
  - Instructions available, if required (do not assume the user understands)
  - User does not need to speak to developer at all to use the application
- Proper commenting and structure of code
- Student does not utilize tutorial or pre-baked code to create final project
  - Simple algorithms (ie. randInt) or CSS examples excluded
- **Due no later than Tuesday, Jan 23rd @ 8:30am**

### Project Ideas (in no particular order)

- Minesweeper (add your own twist?)
- Battleship
- Backgammon
- Solitaire (or other card games)
- Side-scroller similar to Flappy-Bird
- Chess or Checkers (a good challenge)
- Snake (fairly simple but involves animation)
- Tetris
- 2048 (harder than you think)
- Space Invaders or Similar
- [Crossword puzzle generator](https://crosswordlabs.com/)
- [Word search generator](https://thewordsearch.com/maker/)
- [Maze generator](https://www.mazegenerator.net/) (and solver?)

### _Suggested_ Timeline (Descriptions below the table)

| Proposal Submission | Draft GUI (Storyboarding) | Data structure & Pseudocode | Code | Test & Fix | Submit _by_|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Dec. 12th| Dec 13-15th|Dec. 18-19th|Dec. 20th - Jan. 17th|Jan 18-22nd|Jan 23rd @ 8:30am|

### Step 1: Proposal
[Complete this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYXBfspLdxx4dWfqBpX3bY1Ffq9Ng47MlwBIFt5-fb1eI8zg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to the best of your ability. Expect potential changes or discussion with your teacher within a day or two.

### Step 2: Draft GUI (Storyboarding)
On paper, a whiteboard, or a digital image (you could use [`Storyboards.draw`](#Planning/Storyboards.draw) if you wish). Create and submit a draft design for the front-end of the program. This will include any and all input/control from the user as well as extra pages or information panels. Try to be detailed and as complete as possible here in order to make your coding portion simpler. (It is **ok** if the final product does _not_ match your draft. Do not modify it afterward.)

### Step 3: Data Structure & Pseudocode
Now that you have a front-end, you can begin designing the data structure and functions for your program.
- What sort of data structure will you need - arrays? A matrix? Classes?
  - Do any need to be _global_ variables?
  - Does your OOP involve _inheritance_?
  - Are you over-complicating your data structure? (don't do that)
- Are you using a canvas or other HTML elements?
- Do you need event listeners?
  - What are the listeners?
    - If keys or mouse, what information do you need like keyCodes or mouse buttons?
  - What function(s) will those listeners be calling?
- What is the functional structure of the program?
  - What helper functions do you think you'll need?

Inside the [Planning](#Planning) folder, upload a text file or image of your planning and pseudocode. Try to work in an organized fashion so you can read your own work!

(It is ok if your code structure changes - especially your data structurer or major algorithms, this is all part of the planning.)

### Step 4: Code, code, code
If you planned the GUI and the code structure properly, the coding should be easier at this point.
- Create the basic GUI. **Don't worry about colours, fonts, design** - don't even worry about specific photos (you can replace them later). Give your elements meaningful IDs and create a layout that mimics your storyboards.
  - Have you noticed changes you'll need to make? That's ok, make them!
- I cannot stress enough how important it is to avoid making it _look good_ at this point. **Get it working first!**
- Connect your HTML to the JavaScript file.
  - Enable the event listeners and make sure they work.
  - Create the data structure you decided upon. 
- Write the functions one-by-one, testing as necessary.
- Keep notes on changes you foresee or extra functions and algorithms you did not realize you would need during your planning stages. (_Do not change your storyboards or pseudocode for these adjustments_)
- Test, test, test...
- **COMMENT YOUR CODE AS YOU GO!**


### Step 5: Testing & Final Fixes
Test your program extensively and often. Have _someone else_ test your program extensively. Make the appropriate bug fixes or changes to your program. Listen to your tester(s) and consider their input. Just because you thought of it, doesn't mean it's best layout or setup.
Then test it again. And again.

### Submit!


## Rubric: 
This rubric is a work in progress and _input from the class is encouraged_

|Expectation Description|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Level 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Project proposal**|Proposal is vague, incomplete, and/or not submitted on time.|Proposal includes some description and/or some final expectations and is submitted on or near the due date.|Proposal is submitted on-time, includes a description of the program and final expectations.|Proposal is submitted on-time (or early) and includes description, expectations, UI examples, and more.|
|**Draft User Interface**|Draft UI is not representative of the chosen application, is incomplete or missing key features.|x | x|x |
|**Data structure, plan, pseudocode**|Data structure and planning is incomplete or missing key details/features.|x|x|x|
|**Code**| Code is... | x | x | Code is clean & structured, functions and data are named clearly & appropriately. Code is structured neatly, tabbed properly, and easy to read or follow. Globals and listeners are declared at the top with functions declared in an appropriate style and order.
Code Documentation | x | x | x | Developer has supplied a thorough documentation of code including file header(s) and algorithm descriptions. Variables and data structure are explained, along with functions and helper-functions or classes. Comments are concise but give detail, written in a grammatically correct and pleasing style.|
|Application Instructions| x | x | x | The application includes how-to instructions for the user, clearly identifying how to use the program, along with the various modes or functions of the application. Instructions are not obtrusive or in-your-face, they are easy to read and easy to understand.|
|Application Usability| x | x | x | x |
|Application Completion| x | x | x | x |
